/*Given an N*N integer square matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction.
Try using it without any extra space.
Note : You just need to change in the given input itself. No need to return or print anything.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integers N
Next N lines : N integers, elements of one row (separated by space)
Output Format :
Updated matrix
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 1000
Sample Input :
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output :
3  6  9 
2  5  8 
1  4  7
